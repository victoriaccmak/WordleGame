# Wordle Game

## Project Description

This Wordle game is the project for my Programming Assignment 1 in my computer science class in grade 12 (ICS4U). It earned a 100% in the course. In this game, you try to guess a five-letter word in a limited amount of guesses using color-coded hints.

Using C# with .NET Framework in Visual Studios, a fun, thought-provoking game was created as a Console app. Two files were provided by the teacher containing all valid words that are loaded into the game.

This project demonstrates a mastery of file I/O, ASCII characters for the graphics, game states and data structures (lists, multi-dimensional arrays). File I/O was used to read in the dictionary text files, store the game board, and store/update the statistics. 

## How to Install and Run the Game

In order to run the game, Visual Studios 2019 is required. The entire folder, Escape, can be cloned on to your own machine to be run. 

##How to Play

To select your choices in the menu, simply type in your choice and press ENTER. When you are playing the game, simply type in your answer and press ENTER. A green letter means that it was used int the right spot. A Yellow letter means that it is in the word, but in the wrong position. A gray letter means that the letter is not in the word. Guess the word within six guesses with these hints!
